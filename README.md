# NetWatch

**NetWatch** is a Python-based **network traffic monitoring and intrusion detection tool**.  
It captures network packets, analyzes traffic, detects suspicious activity, and provides a **real-time web dashboard**.

Inspired by tools like **nmap, Wireshark, and Metasploit**, NetWatch is designed for security enthusiasts, pentesters, and network administrators.
